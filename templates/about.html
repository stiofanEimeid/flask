        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting
            Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled 
            Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost
            family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had
            been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug
            came and took it.) Remembering that he had once
            known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
            Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their 
            company because he knew that stealth and cunning
            were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed 
            that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
            prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action.
            The superstitious Dwarves also considered
            thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf
            had planned to leave on other business, welcomed
            a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to
                Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city
                of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, 
                he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain
                were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become
                a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
                TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
                beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in
                the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken
                tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
                gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would
                remain with him even in death.

                    Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder
                    brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
                    Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of
                    Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
                    nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin,
                and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when
                travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with
                Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company
                on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.
                Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along
                with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He
                fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later
                settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <p>
                n TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar,
                the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin
                and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among
                the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the
                Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug.
                He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother
                Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves
                made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. After the
                battle, he settled back into the Lonely Mountain.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon
                Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven
                from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in
                approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when
                he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured
                and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin
                was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second
                and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others
                accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party
                was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night
                when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain.
                After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to
                Thorin to inform him the news.

                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years.
                In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled
                with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for
                the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the
                other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies,
                and he survived it.

                is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain
                by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked
                as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains,

                Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother Bofur
                and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from Dwarves
                of Moria. His birth year is also unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest
                to Erebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the 13 "by some
                fifty years" and that after Thorin had been captured, Balin was "the eldest left". Since Fíli
                was born in TA 2859 and Balin was born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763
                and 2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.
                Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains with Thorin after the loss of
                Thráin II.

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                In Valinor, Gandalf was known as Olórin. As recounted in the "Valaquenta" in The Silmarillion,
                he was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala Manwë; and was
                said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo,
                in whose gardens he lived, and Nienna, the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the
                Valar decided to send the order of the Wizards (Istari) to Middle-earth in order to counsel and
                assist all those who opposed Sauron, Olórin was proposed by Manwë. Olórin initially begged to be
                excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manwë replied that that was
                all the more reason for him to go.

                As one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form.
                As one of those spirits, Olórin was in service to the Creator (Eru Ilúvatar) and the Creator's
                'Secret Fire'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took
                on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to
                advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with his own, and hopefully the
                kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a
                more glorious form giving them direct commands.
